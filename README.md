Driver Assistant AI

A smart driving assistant that analyzes driver behavior (speed, distraction, harsh driving actions) and generates a driving score based on multiple safety criteria.
The application uses AI to detect risky behaviors and provide real-time warnings.

Key Features:

Speed detection using GPS

Harsh braking / sudden acceleration detection and intelligent warnings

Driving score calculation based on multiple indicators

Weekly quiz for awareness and responsible mobility

AI Components

Behavioral analysis (speed patterns, braking patterns)

Intelligent scoring algorithm

Smart warning system that adapts to driver behavior
